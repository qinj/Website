				<h3>Hi! Welcome to The BAR ! </h3>
					<p>We are a lifegroup within the community of Harvest Mission Community Church. The BAR is an acronym for The Broken And Redeemed. We believe that our life group should represent a casual, yet open environment akin to a bar. Various people go to a bar. Some might be celebration an achievement, others might be going to drink off a harsh setback. We advocate people to come as they are no matter what season of life they are in.</p>
